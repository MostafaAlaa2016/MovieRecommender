# MovieRecommender
Implementation of a basic movie recommendation system using [Apache Spark 1.6.1](http://spark.apache.org/) and the [MovieLens](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/) data set. This material was originally presented by me (Cliff Laschet) at [Nextbuild 2016](http://nextbuild.nl/), held at the High Tech Campus in Eindhoven. The slide deck accompanying this software is available as PDF and located in the `/slides` directory of this repo.

You can **contact** me through my [LinkedIn page](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/cliff-laschet-91164195).

##Running the pre-built artifact
An out of the box runnable artifact is provided in the `/dist` directory, and can be started by executing the command below, provided you have a recent version of Java installed on your system.

```
java -jar MovieRecommender.jar
```

##Usage
The movie recommender will start by asking your ratings for several well-known movies, after which a top 25 list of best movie picks is shown, tailored to your movie interests. 

##Using the source code directly
This software requires [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) (2.10.5) and [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) (0.13.8) to be installed on your system. Using SBT, the project may be run by, in the root project directory, executing `sbt run`. This will resolve all dependencies and other setup requirements and subsequently run the main method of the source code.

A runnable standalone artifact (fat JAR) may be generated by calling `sbt assembly`, generating the artifact in the `/target/scala-2.10` directory.
