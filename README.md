# MovieRecommender
Implementation of a basic movie recommendation system using [Apache Spark 1.6.1](http://spark.apache.org/) and the [MovieLens](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/) data set. This material was originally presented by me (Cliff Laschet) at Nextbuild 2016, held at the High Tech Campus in Eindhoven. The slide deck accompanying this software is available as PDF and located in `/slides`.

##Running the pre-built artifact
An out of the box runnable artifact is provided in the `/dist` directory, and can be started by executing the command below, provided you have a recent version of Java installed on your system.

```
java -jar MovieRecommender.jar
```

##Usage
The movie recommender will start by asking your ratings for several well-known movies, after which a top 25 list of best movie picks is shown, tailored to your movie interests. 

##Using the source code directly
This software requires [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) (2.10.5) and [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) (0.13.8) to be installed on your system. Using SBT, the project may be run by, in the root project directory, executing `sbt run`. This will resolve all dependencies and other setup requirements and subsequently run the main method of the source code.

A runnable standalone artifact (fat JAR) may be generated by calling `sbt assembly`, generating the artifact in the `/target/scala-2.10` directory.
